	* variables.lisp: 
		Exported variable names.

	* package.lisp (def): 
		Changed macro to also export the function names.

	* getyx.lisp: 
		Made get*yx macros always free their foreign structure and
		added get-*yx functions that return the coordinates as
		multiple values instead of setf'ing them. Also unbreak the
		macros and export all the names.

	* glue.lisp: 
		Renamed to lisp-glue.lisp, because of name conflict
		with glue.c.
