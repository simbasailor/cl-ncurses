CL-Ncurses is a Ncurses interface for Common Lisp on Unix-platforms. It is 
licensed under a MIT-style license. CL-Ncurses uses UFFI for foreign bindings
and it is developed with SBCL on Debian GNU/Linux.

To use cl-ncurses:

 (require :uffi)
 (asdf:oos 'asdf:load-op 'cl-ncurses)

The organization of files corresponds to ncurses manual pages:
eg. functions described in initscr(3) are dealt with in initscr.lisp.

Types and convenience macros reside in package.lisp.
Ncurses's constants reside in constants.lisp.
Ncurses's variables reside in variables.lisp.

There are some tests in the "test" directory.
